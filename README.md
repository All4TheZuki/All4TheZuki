- 👋 Hi, I’m @All4TheZuki
- 👀 I’m interested in all things technical/mechanical
- 🌱 I’m currently learning as much as I can about everything
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... Well I really don't know much about the behind the scenes of coding and whatnot but I can
     follow instructions and usually am willing to experiment, if it's not my daily driver.
- 📫 How to reach me drop a line here I suppose
